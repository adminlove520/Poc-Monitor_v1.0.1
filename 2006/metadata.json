{"CVE-2006-20001":{"Published":"2023-01-17T20:15:00","summary":"A carefully crafted If: request header can cause a memory read, or write of a single zero byte, in a pool (heap) memory location beyond the header value sent. This could cause the process to crash. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.54 and earlier."},"CVE-2006-2842":{"Published":"2006-06-06T20:06:00","summary":"** DISPUTED **  PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in functions/plugin.php in SquirrelMail 1.4.6 and earlier, if register_globals is enabled and magic_quotes_gpc is disabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the plugins array parameter.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by third parties, who state that Squirrelmail provides prominent warnings to the administrator when register_globals is enabled.  Since the varieties of administrator negligence are uncountable, perhaps this type of issue should not be included in CVE.  However, the original developer has posted a security advisory, so there might be relevant real-world environments under which this vulnerability is applicable. Successful exploitation requires that \"register_globals\" is enabled and \"magic_quotes_gpc\" is disabled."},"CVE-2006-3360":{"Published":"2006-07-06T20:05:00","summary":"Directory traversal vulnerability in index.php in phpSysInfo 2.5.1 allows remote attackers to determine the existence of arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) sequence and a trailing null (%00) byte in the lng parameter, which will display a different error message if the file exists."},"CVE-2006-3392":{"Published":"2006-07-06T20:05:00","summary":"Webmin before 1.290 and Usermin before 1.220 calls the simplify_path function before decoding HTML, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files, as demonstrated using \"..%01\" sequences, which bypass the removal of \"../\" sequences before bytes such as \"%01\" are removed from the filename.  NOTE: This is a different issue than CVE-2006-3274."},"CVE-2006-7204":{"Published":"2007-05-22T19:30:00","summary":"The imap_body function in PHP before 4.4.4 does not implement safemode or open_basedir checks, which allows local users to read arbitrary files or list arbitrary directory contents."}}
