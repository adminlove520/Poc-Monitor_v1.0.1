微軟（Microsoft）上周公布了修補遭到駭客攻擊的 Exchange Server 漏洞，全球恐有數萬個組織受到影響。網域與被入侵的Exchange郵件伺服器有關，而這臺伺服器後來被駭客當作C\u0026C中繼站使用，導致接下來發生加密攻擊事故。   嚴重性: 全球企業普遍使用微軟生態系執行日常業務，若遭受駭客攻擊，將造成用戶機敏資料外洩並導致極大損失。雖然微軟已推出更新補釘，但阿戴爾強調這尚未去除儲存在受害伺服器內的後門殼層（webshell），因此就算尚未受到攻擊的企業可以免於被駭風險，駭客仍有時間入侵已被駭的伺服器留下「定時炸彈」。 從2020年開始，美國便不斷指控中國入侵多家醫藥公司及學術單位，試圖竊取疫苗研發機密，這次事件很可能將使中美之間的關係進一步惡化。至於華為、TikTok等中國服務是否會受到這次駭客事件波及，則暫時還不明朗。   漏洞通報程序: 在2年前，曾經拿下資安圈漏洞奧斯卡獎Pwnie Awards「最佳伺服器漏洞獎」戴夫寇爾首席資安研究員Orange Tsai（蔡政達），漏洞通報記錄不勝枚舉，後來因為針對企業常用的SSL VPN進行漏洞研究與通報，更是在全球資安圈聲名大噪。 不過，在今年3月2日卻發生讓Orange Tsai錯愕不已的事情。那就是，他在今年一月跟微軟通報的2個Exchange漏洞，微軟原訂在3月9日對外釋出修補程式，卻突然提前一週，在3月2日便緊急釋出修補程式。原來是因為，在2月26日到2月28日，這個週五下班後到週末這段期間，全球各地發生許多利用微軟Exchange漏洞發動攻擊的資安事件。   攻擊本質: 有人在網路上大量掃描微軟於本月修補的CVE-2020-0688安全漏洞，該漏洞攸關Microsoft Exchange伺服器，呼籲Exchange用戶應儘速修補。 CVE-2020-0688漏洞肇因於Exchange伺服器在安裝時沒能妥善建立唯一金鑰，將允許具備該知識及信箱的授權用戶以系統權限傳遞任意物件，屬於遠端程式攻擊漏洞，該漏洞影響Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 SP3、Microsoft Exchange Server 2013、Microsoft Exchange Server 2016與Microsoft Exchange Server 2019，但只被微軟列為重要（Important）等級的風險。","fork":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ann0906/proxylogon","created_at":"2021-05-03T09:44:25Z","updated_at":"2021-05-03T09:52:40Z","pushed_at":"2021-05-03T09:44:25Z","stargazers_count":0,"watchers_count":0,"forks_count":0,"archived":false,"disabled":false,"allow_forking":true,"is_template":false,"topics":[],"visibility":"public","forks":0,"watchers":0,"default_branch":"main","score":1},{"id":946766026,"node_id":"R_kgDOOG6Ayg","name":"CVE-2024-34370","full_name":"pashayogi/CVE-2024-34370","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pashayogi","id":50790111,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzkwMTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50790111?v=4","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pashayogi","html_url":"https://github.com/pashayogi","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pashayogi/CVE-2024-34370","description":"CVE-2024-34370,
